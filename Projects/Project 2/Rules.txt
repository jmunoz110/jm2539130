Pig is a simple game that requires only one die and can be played with any NEWLINE number of people. Gameplay consists of a player rolling a die. If any number NEWLINE other than a one is rolled, then the face value of the die is added
to their NEWLINE temporary total. At this point, the player now has the choice of either rolling NEWLINE again or "holding". Holding will add their temporary total to their actual NEWLINE total, but their turn will end. If the player
rolls a one, the temporary total NEWLINE they have accumulated is not added to their actual total and their turn ends. NEWLINE The first player to reach one hundred points wins.
