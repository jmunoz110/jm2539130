Pig is a simple game that requires only one die and can be played with any number of people. Gameplay consists of a player rolling a die. If any number other than a
one is rolled, then the die's face value is added to their temporary total. At this point, the player now has the choice of either rolling again or "holding".
Holding will add their temporary total to their actual total, but their turn will end. If the player rolls a one, the temporary total they have accumulated
is not added to their actual total and their turn ends. The first player to reach 100 points wins.
